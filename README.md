# Face Detection API test with "Pixelate" like effect
-------------

This one was given an exercise from a [wesbos`s course](http://wesbos.com). It depends on the FaceDetection API, so your browser must implement it. On Chrome, you can enable this experimental API on the flags page (chrome://flags/), setting **Experimental Web Platform features** to ***Enabled***.
